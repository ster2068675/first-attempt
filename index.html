      <h1>Hi, I'm Sterling!</h1>
      <p>I am a 3rd year IT student at Nova Southeastern University. I was originally a CompSci Major but switched to IT after adding a Graphic Design minor and slightly changing paths.</p>
      <p>As a student, I have gained experience in various technologies via class assignments, projects, and personal studies. Most recently, I have worked with Python, Java, Kotlin, HTML & CSS, and ReactJS. I have also learned about the fundamentals of two-dimensional design and aesthetics through my minor. </p>
      <p>I'm currently working as a Network Technician's Assistant at NSU through their work-study program. I have worked on AP provisioning and maintenance, soft/hardware troubleshooting, inventory management, and more. I have also gained experience working on Official Organization sites complete with eCommerce systems and membership logs using CMS like Wordpress during my internship this semester. </p>
      <p>I hope to combine my love for computer science and information technology, along with my growing fascination with graphic design, into a software/web development position to share what I have learned over the years with a community of passionate developers and dedicated students like myself.</p>
